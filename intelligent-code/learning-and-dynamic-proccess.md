Idea: a small amount of learning can make a huge difference in a already intelligent dynamic system.

Just need to find the right intelligent system to make this work.

One possibility here to show superiority of actual learning over other methods is to show its superiority to things like genetic algrithms.


### Properties of a reasonable simulator

What sorts of problems do we want to see from this learner?

Reinforcement learning is only interesting in cases that have the following properties:

1. The cost function is a complex, non-obvious function of the inputs
2. The outputs actually interact with the enviornment.
3.

## Multiplicative weights update algorithm

This is one of many classical optimization techniques.

People tend not to learn it as an undergrad for two reasons.

1. The proofs that it has good properties are difficult, and require fairly significant mathematical sophistication
2. The most important problems it tries to solve require substantial backgrounds to even understand why the problems are important

There are many good papers out there that describe multiplicative weights mathematically, such as this one: [good multiplicative weights article (not mine)](https://jeremykun.com/2017/02/27/the-reasonable-effectiveness-of-the-multiplicative-weights-update-algorithm/)

However, this does not do a great job at communicating why it works, and certainly it is difficult to see how people would have came up with it.

But the truth is that this is not a difficult algorithm to invent. Many different people from many fields of study independently invented this method to solve the problem at hand. So I hope to show how one might invent a method like this, in the hopes that it communicates how it works better than other explanations. In order to do that, we really have to look at the dynamics of specific optimization problems.

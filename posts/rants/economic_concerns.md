In the past, I believed that while major economic, political, and social issues will continue going unresolved, there will be surprising new trends, businesses, and shifts in focus that will allow the world to stumble along for centuries.

I no longer am so optimistic. The padding modern society has been resting on has worn thin, and the true beams holding up modern society have become exposed. And exposure, like real beams, have accelerated their decay. However, at this moment where we see the beams, before they collapse, we have the unique ability to distinguish the beams, the real stuff upholding society, from the padding, the protective layers that disguised the beams and protected them from assault.

The fundamental beams upholding society are (in no particular order):

* Your existence and nature is not the result of your own efforts. Thus as such that you produce and build with your life is also not entirely due to you, but also that which formed you.
* You are destined to die. Further, you are unlikely to choose the date or circumstances of your death. Thus, you will meet your end at something outside yourself.
* We cannot accomplish anything alone. Most of our tools, techniques, and ideas are due to those who came before us. We receive food, safety, transport, and materials from others who live around us. And finally, an accomplishment is shallow looking forward to the enjoyment it brings others in the future.
* Since neither our beginning nor our end is of our own making, nor is the products. You are not the most important person in the world, or even in the story of your own life.


* Truth/Knowledge: Getting to the bottom of things, rather than relying on convienient stories.
* Death: Valuing the sacrifice of danger and premature death.

 > Do or do not there is no try. -- Yoda

This statement inspires such comment in our society because 1) Unfamiliar with the Buddist philosophy Yoda is drawing upon 2) A instictual sense of deep truth to this statement and are left in confusion due to ignorance of the nature of this truth and 3) Trying is vitally important to our society (did you put in 100% effort? etc.)

### Trying as emotional effort

Our sentimenal society loves associating trying/effort with emotion. Children and teens soak up the tears and cries of battle anime, and feel pumped up and ready to tackle their problems.

In truth, copying the emotional patterns of the successful is an important tool in learning, it allows us to associate some deep, powerful part of ourselves with the behaviors of others, and can be a stepping stone as we practice.

Unfortunately, emotional configuration is no substitute for real skill, or even real commitment, as emotions are fleeting. Worse still, it can lead to plautuing in skill, as these strong emotions start exausing our energy and diverting our efforts. It is often commented on that some of the most deeply committed professionals often appear completely emotionless while focused on their work, almost as if dead or drained. Especially great manga artists, chefs, endurance athletes, and others who work tirelessly for 14+ hours a day.

As such, if trying is emotional effort, then it is a mere crutch, that can get us out of a hole, or past an injury, but should be put aside when we really need to run.

### Trying as signaling commitment

In the past, master/apprentece relationships were strong bonds bound by vows and law. No need to question the commitment of the apprentice, since after their trial period, their success or failure in their trade is their success and failure in life---there is no alternative to distract them.

However, in our freer, modern world, experienced teachers, leaders, bosses, etc, generally like to see strong signs of commitment from someone before they invest a significant period of their time training the person. They have a line of other people they can help if you are not committed. 

So we like to try hard to show these signs of commitment, and display them for all to see. Resume padding, portfolio builing, participation in extra-curriculars, competitions, asking for extra problem sets, etc, are all often done as pleas for attention by those who can help us in our chosen craft. As long as you these work in grabbing the attention of some good teacher, this is a very successful strategy. 

Unfortunately, it is mostly zero sum, and teachers are typically deeply aware of the tricks that their students know to play to grab their attention, and so it becomes an ever more uncertain and taller ladder to climb, the more one belives in this dimension of "try". Worse still, one can confuse these efforts to signal attention with actual accomplishment, later leading to confusion and mistrust in their own judgement or the judgement of others, when they start to confront the nature of real achivement (i.e. the difference between winning a mathmatics competition in high school vs publishing a mathmatics paper in a university, or ).

### Trying as overcoming vulnerability

Vulnerability is important in establishing relationships in all walks of life, including our relationship with our work and mentors. But many of us attempt to shield ourselves, by obsuring our real weaknesses, hiding our real strengths, and failing to truth in others.

Overcoming these sheilds and being vulnerable in our learnings can be one way in which we "try" to improve. But be ware, that vulnerability is an adventure that will lead you through all sorts of trouble. Many mentors and peers may not know how to deal with our raw selves, or may be unworthy of our trust. We may find that our deeply ingranined habits and experiences work better with a neighboring field, and be led around for awhile. In the worst case, you may find yourself adrift, lost in the wilderness, with a mixed set of experiences that is a foundation for nothing.  

### Trying as position choice

Taking plenty of time to investigate various options, and choosing the best way to situate yourself, your emotions, your relationships, your vulernabilities is the last way to try. This colder, more calculating focus on long term success can maximize the benefits of our prior learning and experiences when building future ones, but can lead to needless wasted opportunities and pride.

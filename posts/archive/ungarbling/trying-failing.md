 > Do or do not there is no try. -- Yoda

This statement inspires such comment in our society because 

1. Unfamiliar with the Buddhist philosophy Yoda is drawing upon. Over-familiarity with western concepts of trying that emerge from the philosophy of free-will has bred contempt, and this new, contrary idea breeds fascination.  
2. A instinctual sense of deep truth to this statement and are left in confusion due to ignorance of the nature of this truth.
3. Trying is vitally important to our society (did you put in 100% effort? etc.)

Here are 4 different, ways of describing this trying behavior:

1. [Emotional Effort](#trying-as-emotional-effort)
4. [Signaling Commitment](#trying-as-signaling-commitment)
2. [Overcoming Vulnerability](#trying-as-overcoming-vulnerability)
3. [Choice](#trying-as-position-choice)

### Trying as emotional effort

Our sentimental society loves associating trying/effort with emotion. Children and teens soak up the tears and cries of battle anime, and feel pumped up and ready to tackle their problems.

In truth, copying the emotional patterns of the successful is an important tool in learning, it allows us to associate some deep, powerful part of ourselves with the behaviors of others, and can be a stepping stone as we practice.

Unfortunately, emotional configuration is no substitute for real skill, or even real commitment, as emotions are fleeting. Worse still, it can lead to plateauing in skill, as these strong emotions start exhausting our energy and diverting our efforts. It is often commented on that some of the most deeply committed professionals often appear completely emotionless while focused on their work, almost as if dead or drained. Especially great manga artists, chefs, endurance athletes, and others who work tirelessly for 14+ hours a day.

As such, if trying is emotional effort, then it is a mere crutch, that can get us out of a hole, or past an injury, but should be put aside when we really need to run.

### Trying as signaling commitment

In the past, master/apprentice relationships were strong bonds bound by vows and law. No need to question the commitment of the apprentice, since after their trial period, their success or failure in their trade is their success and failure in life---there is no alternative to distract them.

However, in our freer, modern world, experienced teachers, leaders, bosses, etc, generally like to see strong signs of commitment from someone before they invest a significant period of their time training the person. They have a line of other people they can help if you are not committed. 

So we like to try hard to show these signs of commitment, and display them for all to see. Resume padding, portfolio building, participation in extra-curriculars, competitions, asking for extra problem sets, etc, are all often done as pleas for attention by those who can help us in our chosen craft. As long as you these work in grabbing the attention of some good teacher, this is a very successful strategy. 

Unfortunately, it is mostly zero sum, and teachers are typically deeply aware of the tricks that their students know to play to grab their attention, and so it becomes an ever more uncertain and taller ladder to climb. And of course, the steeper the mountain, the stronger the signal, and the more real this dimension of "try" becomes. Worse still, one can confuse these efforts to signal attention with actual accomplishment, later leading to confusion and mistrust in their own judgement or the judgement of others, when they start to confront the nature of real achievement (i.e. the difference between winning a mathematics competition in high school vs publishing a mathematics paper in a university, or earning a tenured professorship position as a mathematician).

### Trying as overcoming vulnerability

Vulnerability is important in establishing relationships in all walks of life, including our relationship with our work and mentors. But many of us attempt to shield ourselves, by obscuring our real weaknesses, hiding our real strengths, and failing to truth in others.

Overcoming these shields and being vulnerable in our learnings can be one way in which we "try" to improve. But be ware, that vulnerability is an adventure that will lead you through all sorts of trouble. Many mentors and peers may not know how to deal with our raw selves, or may be unworthy of our trust. We may find that our deeply ingrained habits and experiences work better with a neighboring field, and be led around for awhile. In the worst case, you may find yourself adrift, lost in the wilderness, with a mixed set of experiences that is a foundation for nothing. 

However, at best, vulnerability will open us up into an long cycle of opportunities and obligations, trials and rewards, heavy weights and solid support. 

### Trying as position choice

Taking plenty of time to investigate various options, and choosing the best way to situate yourself, your emotions, your relationships, your vulnerabilities is the last way to try. This colder, more calculating focus on long term success can maximize the benefits of our prior learning and experiences when building future ones, but can lead to needless wasted opportunities and pride. 

1. Pride that one's decisions are best typically blocks vulnerabilities. 
2. Passed up opportunities due to lack of confidence or knowledge can greatly diminish signaling strength. 
3. Emotional strength is spread thin by emotional attachment to the choices passed up

These are all possible to overcome. Careful consulting and humility practices can overcome pride in one's decision capabilities. Emotional attachment to passed up decisions can be fixed with detachment practices. Missed signaling opportunities can be fixed with portfolio building, networking, and experience diversification.

Many people understand what algorithms are used for, and how we implement them. However, I believe there is a greater story to process. That is, we create these algorithms because they do work for us. And that work is the work of intelligence.

So instead of seeing computational methods through the lens of math, lets look at them through the lens of intelligence. This way, we will be able to have a much broader sense of what computers can do, and how to use them to solve everyday problems.

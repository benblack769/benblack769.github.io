# Math and Computer Science

Math and computer science have a long history together. Some of the biggest figures in Computer Science, including Alan Turing, Von Neumann, and Donald Knuth were PhDs in pure mathematics. This connection is not accidental. The work they were doing was all very serious mathematics, even if much of it looks like engineering today.

## Computer science needs math

And yet, in the 21st century, the increasing sophistication of tools and best practices have allowed many good computer scientists to not see the deep connections between the two subjects.

But I always believe that if you are a computer scientist, and you want to make meaningful conceptual contributions to the subject area, then a deep understanding of mathematics is essential. And even if you only wish to contribute more empirical and applied work, then I believe that mathematical skill is incredibly valuable.  

### Skill: Analysis of API properties



### Concept: Structured Reasoning

All purely conceptual work is primarily philosophy. This is pretty much by definition of what philosophy is, the study of things that other subjects do not have methods of studying. And like most fields of study, computer scientists like to think of conceptual gains as manna from heaven, rather than trying to study it. Philosophy does try to study this process, however. Discussion of what makes a good theory, and perhaps even how to go about constructing one is a feature of all good philosophy classes.

Interestingly enough, there is another field that attempts to study theory itself: Pure mathematics. In the 20th century, so many new mathematical theories started appearing, that there was serious work in understanding what separated out the useful ones from the useless ones. And any good mathematics researcher understands these principles. Now I am not a good mathematician, so I don't claim to be an expert about this, but I know people who do. And even the basics have completely changed my intellectual focus.



## Math needs computer science
On the other hand, some Mathematicians believe that they can avoid working with computers by simply delving into more pure areas.

And I have met a couple of computer scientists, who think that the very most interesting and valuable mathematics is based upon problems and ideas originating from problems in computer science.

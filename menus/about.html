  <p>
    Right now, I am a M.S. student at the University of Maryland, planning on graduating
    this spring.
  </p>

  <p>
    The focus of my M.S. work was on reinforcement learning, particularly multi-agent
    reinforcement learning evaluation.
  </p>

  <p>
    My undergrad work was focused on CS theory,
    computer systems, and parallel processing.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have always been interested in games, AI, and simulation.

# Understanding the mechanics of deep learning

## Problems deep learning tries to solve

### Image Analysis: Text reading

Consider the CAPTCHA problem:



### Speech recognition

## Key ideas of deep learning, and how they try to solve those problems

### Gradient descent

### NN function (activation/mat mul)

### Backpropagation

## Working example (MNIST)

## Issues with those ideas, and examples of fixes, and visualizations of how they work

## Overview of modern deep learning architectures (LSTM, convolution, attention, softmax probabilities)

## Solving non-standard problems like adversarial learning (if time)

* Deep learning and ANNs are not quite the same:  deep learning implies backpropogation, ANNs make no mention of that idea.

* More art than science
* So different than other ideas that we don't have terminology to talk about them (a whole new branch of science)

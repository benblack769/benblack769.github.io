Artificial neural networks are now used in so many apps and devices, they are quickly becoming a backbone of information technology. But most of the scientists and engineers who use it are forced to treat it like a black box algorithm, since much of its design is based more on experimentation than on principled mathematics. 

I am no expert in neural nets, but I do want to learn how they work at a deep level, and I want to share this exploration with others.

# Things everyone needs to know about Artificial Neural Networks

## Introductory ideas

### Machine learning

### Complex natural functions

### Hierarchical abstraction

## Neural network algorithm

### Algebraic construction
*Diagram*

#### Input/output format
#### Weight matrixes - linear functions define abstractions/interactions
#### Activation function

### Backpropagation

#### Cost function

## Applications/examples

### 






















* More art than science
* So different than other ideas that we don't have terminology to talk about them (a whole new branch of science)

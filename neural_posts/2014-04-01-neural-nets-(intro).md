title: Neural nets intro
---

Neural nets are now in so many apps and devices, they are quickly becoming a backbone of information technology. Every day, we depend on them to process our voice, to translate documents, and to label our friends in Facebook images. Technology firms are constantly testing the latest techniques in new areas. News articles spew out about the latest and greatest successes. AlphaGo stretches the concept of what what a computer can do.

As a result, almost every student of computer science is fascinated by them. But I think what attracts so many people to it is not just its glamour and popularity, but also its mystery. In many ways, it is the ultimate black box algorithm. All the general public is told is that it is based off of the human brain. Your typical CS undergraduate will look at it and learn about its structure and math, but somehow pick up little of real use.

I will be doing a series on my own exploration of this subject, and try to demonstrate my own method of learning how it actually works. I am no expert in neural nets. I spent a month or two learning about them from excellent sources like <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">this</a>. So don't take my word for anything! Instead, try things on your own, and see how it turns out for you.

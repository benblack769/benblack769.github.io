My [Intuition and Structure](coding_posts/intuition-structure) page describes how to build decent code from scratch. However, what happens when you are given a awful codebase, and expected to do things with it quickly?

There are 2 obvious options:

1. Rewrite the code, then make the changes
2. Hack in the change to the existing code

I think the best way is to take the best parts of these two ideas by the following process:

1. Identify the structure of the current code
2. Identify the structure of the code you want to have
3. Make minimal movement towards the structure you want to have in order to make the change you want

## Tick Tack Toe example

Below is some code that allows you to play tick tack toe. I wrote it when I learned programming for the first time. In fact, it is the first code I was proud of. It is doing something kind of amazing, after all: perfectly executing a more or less optimal strategy (at least for the first player). It looks like this:

### Process

Clearly, there are a bunch of problems with this code. But hopefully it looks complicated enough that you don't want to try to fix it all at once, which is why it makes a good example. I will walk you through the following steps of fixing this code:

1. Cross-Platform Support
2. Data structure cleanup
3. Testable logic
4. Structured AI

### Cross-Platform Support

The most serious problem here is the Windows specific code. I want my Mac and Linux friends to be able to use this too!

A quick scan through the code shows that there is only a few bits which uses the window.h API: the `SetConsoleCursorPosition` call on lines 26 and 36. There is also a system dependent `system("cls")` call on line 366. Lets look at the `SetConsoleCursorPosition` call first, as it is more complicated:

```c++
COORD coord = {0,0};
void place(int entry, char playchoice)
{
    int x, y;
       if(entry % 3 == 1)
        x = 0;
       if (entry % 3 == 2)
        x = 4;
       if (entry % 3 == 0)
        x = 8;

       if ((entry - 1) / 3 == 0)
        y = 11;
       else if ((entry - 1) /3 == 1)
        y = 13;
       if ((entry - 1) / 3 == 2)
        y = 15;
    COORD coord;
    coord.X = x;
    coord.Y = y;
    SetConsoleCursorPosition(GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE), coord);
if (playchoice == 'X')
cout << "X";
else
cout << "O";

    coord.X = 0;
    coord.Y = 16;
    SetConsoleCursorPosition(GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE), coord);

}
```

How on earth can we turn this mess into something cross-platform?  What is this mess? What is it accomplishing in this program?

Remember, the goal is to fix this quickly, and the easiest thing to do here is replace the `SetConsoleCursorPosition(GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE), coord)` call with a similar cross platform call.

After a quick search, the best I could find is [the solution to this question](http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/general/41709/). Copied here:

```c++
#ifdef _WIN32

#include <windows.h>

void gotoxy( int x, int y )
{
    COORD p = { x, y };
    SetConsoleCursorPosition( GetStdHandle( STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE ), p );
}

#else

//Make sure to link properly with the Unix version. You'll need to link with one of
//-lcurses
//-lterminfo
//-lncurses
//(whichever is appropriate for your system).
#include <unistd.h>
#include <term.h>

void gotoxy( int x, int y )
{
    int err;
    if (!cur_term)
      if (setupterm( NULL, STDOUT_FILENO, &err ) == ERR)
        return;
    putp( tparm( tigetstr( "cup" ), y, x, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ) );
}

#endif
```

Wow, this is ugly. And not only is it ugly, we still haven't finished making it truly portable, because it needs to link with different libraries depending on the Unix system. And if we are using some weird operating system, like a really old DOS OS, then even this code won't work.

So, if that is the best we can do to replace the specific API call with a cross-platform one, then I consider this a really poor solution. Lets try to find something better.

What can we do if we cannot make a call like that? Since the exact mechanics of the code cannot be matched, lets try to see what sort of functionality it creates, and see if we can implement that in a different way.

Here is the output of the program in a normal play through:

    Tick Tack Toe

    Do you want to be X (first players) or O (second player)?X
    Enter numbers 1-9(as shown) to play
    1 | 2 | 3
    ---------
    4 | 5 | 6
    ---------
    7 | 8 | 9

    You go first
    O | X | O
    ---------
      | X |
    ---------
      | O | X
    21 1 11 10 12 11 12 11

There are some odd things here, like the string of numbers below the second grid, which I have no idea why it is there, or even where in the code prints it out. But it is better than nothing, so for now, lets not worry about that at all, instead, lets focus on reproducing this general interface without the windows specific API.


The sane thing to do is to print out this whole thing using the game data. Preferably something like this `print_game(data)`. So that is the structure we want to move to.

On the other hand, lets look try to decipher the structure of what it is actually doing. This is the hardest part, so I'll take it slowly this time.

If you [look back](/coding_posts/refractoring/#full-code) at the bits of code where the `place` function is being called, note that a `box#` variable is usually updated when place is called. For example, when user input is used on line 89-93:

```c++
if (entry == 1 and box1 == 0)
{
    box1 = 1;
    place(1, playchoice);
}
```

Looking at the `box#` variables, it is being used to calculate the `num#` variables on line 326, which is used to calculate the strategy and who wins. Making a little leap of inference, the `box#` variables seem to be a significant portion of the game data. And since we know that place is updating the console (since it it talking about setting cursor position, and printing Xs or Os), we can see the structure of what is going on here.

This is an abstraction of the pattern I keep on seeing:

    user-turn and computer-turn:
        input = make_choice(data)
        update_data(input)
        update_console(input)


First, I feel like identifying the structure of the ideal code, because it is fairly simple:

    state: state of the tick tack toe game
    while game continues:
        clear screen
        print game state
        prompt for user input, calculate computer input, update game state


The next step is identifying the structure of the existing code



So lets zoom out a little and see if we can rep

Nicely for us, this part is separated from the rest of the code in a function. However, this function does not


### Data-structure cleanup

As I mentioned in my [post about structure](/coding_posts/intuition-structure), data structures are the most important thing to get right. Hopefully you can see how incredibly shitty the current data structures are, and start to see just how seriously they foil our attempts at making clear code. In the above argument, I kept on having to refer to `box#` variables, instead of a single variable. There were all these cases made necessary by the fact that I had not method to programmatically access different box numbers (e.g., the 9 different cases for user input). Pretty much any more changes to the code (most critically adding testing) will be made far easier by cleaning up these data structures, so lets just get it over with now.

First, lets identify what sort of data structures there should be. 

It represents the 9 boxes as 9 separate variables, box[1-9]. The box is 1 if the player has it, 10 if the computer has it, and 0 if it is empty

### Testable logic

### Structured AI

Here is a relatively simple problem which should demonstrate this. The problem is that I know how to check if someone won in tick tack toe. Simple enough, right? You check the rows, columns, and diagonals, andÂ see if a player occupies all the spots there. But this problem, and other similar to it haunted me for years afterwards, making my code error prone, and difficult to debug.



```c++
    num1 = box1 + box2 + box3;
    num2 = box4 + box5 + box6;
    num3 = box7 + box8 + box9;
    num4 = box1 + box4 + box7;
    num5 = box2 + box5 + box8;
    num6 = box3 + box6 + box9;
    num7 = box1 + box5 + box9;
    num8 = box3 + box5 + box7;
    if (num1 == 30 or num2 == 30 or num3 == 30 or num4 == 30 or num5 == 30 or num6 == 30 or num7 == 30 or num8 == 30)
    {
        cout << "COMPUTER WINS!\n";
        break;
    }
    if (num1 == 3 or num2 == 3 or num3 == 3 or num4 == 3 or num5 == 3 or num6 == 3 or num7 == 3 or num8 == 3)
    {
        cout << "PLAYER WINS!";
        break;
    }
```

As you can see, I could code a solution with the tools I had at hand. And at the time, that was enough. But now, I realize that it is not very good. It has lots and lots of variables and arbitrary constants, which makes checking/debugging the code hard and slow. It is just about impossible to generalize to larger grids. Understandable for my first code, but lets try to do better.

The standard approach would be to iteratively refractor this, until it looks decent. We would put the numbered variables in an array, then loop over them, in some places, take out functions, etc, to make the code more concise and stuff. This is not a bad approach. But it can actually be harder than building it up again from scratch, and it is easier to make poor choices. So instead, lets try to think of things structurally, picking out what each part of the code really accomplishes, and build this up.

First, basic data structures. What is a tick tack toe board anyways? It is a grid that looks like this, right?

    X|O|S
    X|O|_
    O|X|O

We really only care about the rows, columns, and diagonals. If you trace your finger over the rows, columns and diagonals, you might notice that your finger seems to be moving quite freely over a 2 dimensional discrete space. This reveals that the base data structure needs two qualities, it needs to store discrete values. Luckily, there is already a standard solution to general discrete 2d movement, the 2d array.

    board = array[3][3];

Now, how do we represent the Xs, Os, and blanks? Again, think of what we they actually are, and what we need of them. They actually are symbols that represent something about the game. We need them to be distinct from each other, and to not allow for anything other than Xs, Os, and blanks. Here there are several options. Strongly typed enums have these qualities. But perhaps this is overkill, as they also have other guarantees, such as efficient use as a key, which we don't need. So lets make our own type that meets these conditions.



Ok, so that wraps up the data structure. Now we need to look at the tasks we ask of that data. These can be thought of as queries, or manipulations.

Here is a task. We want the user of the software to be able to choose a coordinate, and then set that to be the players symbol if it is not already chosen. If it is already chosen, then we want to change nothing, and tell the user that they need to choose something else.

Wow, that is a lot of requirements. And it is the thing that experienced coders can just crank out without thinking about it at all. So

Here is a more complicated task, the original one.

Lets take

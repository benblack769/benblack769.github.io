Piaget largely ignores the mechanisms which need to occur for his assimilations, accommodation, and organization to occur.

These have a few hard requirements, and some soft requirements

1. It must be relatively easy to set up with some prior structure (Piaget asserts you can only learn with both reflex and reward signals already set up)
2. There must be some way of online assimilation to events. This means that the framework of the schema must be adaptable using its dynamic runtime components such that different stable equilibrium are produced based on input.
3. To perform accommodation, the schema must be able to effectively differentiate between its old self and the new self produced by the assimilation *not obvious how this is done*.
4. Interest. Interesting events are those which can be accommodated successfully, that is, after some dynamic change, there are better results. Interest is a reward, and can be navigated using assimilation in turn. (the real circular reaction, then is between interest and assimilation, with accommodation as the useful byproduct).

Jean Piaget's idea of accommodation is as follows:

An emotional need is useless to understand unless the body can act to achieve that goal better. The only way to do that is for the body to actually do something with objects around it. Accommodation is when the body interacts with these object, and by doing so, finds adaptations to work with these objects to achieve its goals. The idea is that the body's schema is accommodating itself to fit into reality.

### Prerequisites

There are a few prerequisites for accommodation to actually occur.

* First, the body needs to have some action structure in place that moves the body around such that a movement can interact with an object in a successful way.
* Second, the sensory/reward structure needs to be in place to understand when an interaction has been more successful and when it has been less successful.

At the very beginning of the learning process, the first step is taken care of by hard-coded reflex, and the second step is taken care of by assimilation.

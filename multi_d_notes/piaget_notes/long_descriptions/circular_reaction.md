A circular reaction is when an action causes a positive emotion response which causes the individual to repeat that same action.

The theory is that this occurs because accommodation and assimilation go back and forth to produce repetitive behavior.
More specifically, the current reflex schema produces an action with some amount of randomness. With low probability, the assimilation schema will signal that this action was associated with a need. The reflex schema will respond to this signal by fixing the initial conditions it remembers so that the behavior is repeated with high probability. At the same time, the reflex schema will be accommodating itself to the understanding of that action being desirable. Eventually, when the reflex schema has fully accommodated that object, the action will no longer be one explored at random with low probability, but directed with high probability, and so there will no longer be any element of surprise at its success. So the assimilation schema will not activate, and the cyclic behavior will end.

### Refined thoughts

To start, there are two things. A reflex schema which defines how the system reacts to a given input. Also a new situation, where an external object interacts with the environment around it. 

Assimilation first allows the schema to absorb the object. So within the schema, there are slow, but successful adaptations to the scene which improve the schema's objective.

Accommodation then happens which allows the schema to differentiate between its earlier self, and the self which was assimilating the object. This can be viewed as conforming to the assimilatory adaptations, or strengthening them so they happen again.

Since the accommodation strengthened the connection, it is more likely that the schema is activated in this new way again, starting the cycle over. Note that it will end to some degree once the assimilation no longer has to occur in order to maximize the reward, that is, the schema perfectly matches the objects, so no assimilation or accommodation needs to take place, so there is no interest in pursuing this path, and interest will be lost.

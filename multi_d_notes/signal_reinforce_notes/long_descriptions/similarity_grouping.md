* The problem interference tries to solve is the problem where every neuron sends the same signal, because signals are reinforced if they are stead, meaning nothing interesting ever can get learned.
* But destructive interference only happens locally. This means that at a global level, there is still potential for massive waste due to massively replicated signals.
* The goal is NOT to remove all replicated signals, indeed some degree of replicated signals are very important for learning (to link vision to eyesight, similar signals from both sources must be matched together, which could mean identical signals are linked together, this is a good thing)
* But the obvious replicated signals should be grouped together as needed to minimize the duplication
* In Biological systems, this grouping is probably achieved by physical attraction in a 3d space.

* Groups of neurons should only be able to release a certain amount of energy in the form of signals
* In a layered system, this destructive interference occurs within a layer
* Idea similar to Contrastive divergence algorithm for Deep belief networks (stacked Restricted Boltzman machines)
* Idea similar to Hinton's capsules for computer vision
* Happens online

* Strong, stable signals should be reinforced and strengthened. 
* Signals which did not contribute to that strong stable signal should be correspondingly weakened
* In a layered system, this signal is propagated between layers.
* Intuitively, the goal is to make sure signals that are happened across by chance are reinforced.
* Signal reinforcement happens much slower than signals are propagated, so any method requires accumulation of signal transfer.
* Problem is that signals will eventually strengthen without limit.

<p>A combination of 3 different insights</p>

<p>If I am right this should have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Better sample efficiency due to reward factorization (giving stronger learning signal)</li>
  <li>Less biased value estimator (due to target value learning)</li>
  <li>Unsupervised skill discovery (due to information encoding from clock-DIAYN)</li>
</ol>

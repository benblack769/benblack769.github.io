<p>Population based training is an evolutionary way of tuning hyperparameters based of memetic algorithms.</p>

<p>Idea is to have a bunch of agents, all training, and their hyperparameters change over time due as they interact.</p>

<h3 id="application-to-alphastar">Application to alphastar</h3>

<p>In AlphaStar, there is a</p>

<ul>
  <li>selection process: tournament results</li>
  <li>Highly changing loss surface due to strategic interactions and value function learning</li>
</ul>

<p>Which makes it suited for PBT.</p>

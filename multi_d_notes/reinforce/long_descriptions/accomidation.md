Jean Piaget's idea of accommodation is quite similar to reinforcement learning, but with strong signals.

An emotional need is useless to understand unless the body can act to achieve that goal better. The only way to do that is for the body to actually do something with objects around it. When the body interacts with these object, and by doing so, finds ways of working with these objects to achieve its goals, this is accommodation. The idea is that the body's schema is accommodating itself to fit into reality.

# Imaginative Coding

I think that coding gets an awfully bad rap among non-coders, often justifiably. Here are some things I have noticed that stopped people from coding.

* Code is off-putting
  * Code is in ugly, hard to read fixed width font.
  * The terminal is scary because of risk of screwing up to your computer.
* People think they won’t be good at it.
  * People run into those way better than them and loose hope.
  * Online learning tools hammer people with technical terms.
  * The community values cleverness over creativity (more on that in later posts).
* People don’t feel the need to learn it
  * It doesn’t look very interesting
  * Not required in most high schools or colleges
  * Not required for useful computer work

I am sure I am missing some things here, but hopefully you get the idea.

My goal in this blog is to communicate my own idea of what code should be like, and hopefully convince you that it is an incredible tool that can be used to lead more creative, more imaginative lives. My hope is that coders will see more opportunities to explore, and non-coders will see a soft side to coding. Perhaps some will see, like I did, that the experience of creating something amazing makes all the hard work worth it.

It will also be a showcasing of some of my more interesting work. I will try to make it available to a general audience, but I will not be explaining things completely from scratch either. If something is too confusing, please comment, and I will try to fix it.

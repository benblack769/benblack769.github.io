<p>DIAYN maximizes information about an episode while maximizing entropy.</p>

<p>Leads to unsupervised skill discovery.</p>

<h3 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h3>

<p>System tries to maximize mutual information between environment state and random source.</p>

<p>Discriminator evaluates mutual information between the two.</p>

<p>Policy tries to maximize discounted discriminator reward over time.</p>

<p>Entropy is maximized via SAC entropy regularization.</p>

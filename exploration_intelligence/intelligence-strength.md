slug: apparent-intelligence
excerpt: "People have different ideas of what intelligence is, and what is and is not intelligence. This makes some of my posts about natural intelligences like social and evolutionary intelligence seem deeply misleading to many people. In order to have a coherent shared vision of what natural and social intelligences are, I break down exactly what intelligence parts so that when we talk about inteligence, everyone can understand what I am saying."

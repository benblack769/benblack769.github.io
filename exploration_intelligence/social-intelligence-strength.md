excerpt: "Social intelligence is rather remarkable. Out of many individuals clamoring for attention, social intelligence can easily filter out the best from the rest. But Philosophers have emphasized the importance of this sort of social intelligence in science. But this is the weakest of all social intelligence. In more tightly knit societies, social intelligence can be much stronger. The weaker types of social intelligence can be easily classified and understood."

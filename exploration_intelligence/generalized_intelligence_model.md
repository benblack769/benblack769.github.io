## Generalized Model of Intelligence

### Preface

The approach described is deeply and subtly inspired by neural networks, and I will reference the terminology. Before continuing, I suggest reading an introduction to basics like backpropagation and gradient descent, how deeper learning works better than shallow learning etc. Much of this will be covered in my introduction to Neural Networks on my site.

### Introduction

While there are current techniques that could maybe be used to solve this problem to some degree, I wanted to try to explore this for myself, so that I could get a more intuitive understanding of the subject. In particular, I wanted to find a method that I can adapt more easily to fit more difficult learning problems like long term memory and meta-intelligence.

# Formalizing Intelligence

What is intelligence? What makes the smart person in the room seem smart? What makes a beehive seem smarter than an individual bee? Why do we appreciate child geniuses more than adults who are just as capable?

This question, more in the field of metaphysics than science, is a question I have asked myself for years. After all, I really like being seen as smart, and if I can answer that question, then I can focus my efforts to make myself smarter.

But recently, I have been thinking the same question in a different context, that of machine intelligence. Why do some people think some applications are smart? Why do more experienced programmers and computer scientists take a more skeptical view of the intelligence of computers than most people? And finally, what can I do to make my code act truly intelligently?

In line with the more philosophical nature of this question, I found my first real insight in a Philosophy of Computation class. In the papers we were reading, there were several skeptics of AI. And in particular, one piqued my interest: "Psychologism and Behaviorism", by Ned Block, Section 2 ( [link](http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/Psychologism.htm)). There, he describes a hypothetical machine that a human programs to respond to every possible set of questions within a fixed amount of time with an appropriate answer. This machine acts intelligently enough to pass the Turing test, but it somehow doesn't seem intelligent. Rather the human programming it is the intelligent one. To, that begs the question: what about this machine makes it unintelligent? I tried to resolve this problem myself. And what I discovered is that intelligence is scales negatively with both decision making time and with amount of data known.

### Precise philosophical framework

If you don't like definitions, feel free to skip to the next part.

Definitions:

The intelligent actor: A being that can affect its environment. It has desires that it wants satisfied.

The world: The place where the intelligent actor makes decisions in, i.e., it can make some limited changes to this world, and the world will have some effect on the intelligent actor's desires. Anything which cannot affect the actor, or that the actor cannot affect is not inside the world.

Inside this world, intelligence is the degree to which

excerpt: "In a complex and adaptive system, different processes and subsystems can be said to play 'roles' in the larger system. Understanding how these roles interact can help us understand the system, even when we don't understand the details of the subsystems themselves. I believe that this is the best way to gain a better understanding our minds and the social structures we live in."

## Abstracting systems

### Example system

The most relevant, interesting, and understandable complex system is the human emotional system.



### System core

At the core, a system has three key components:

* Purpose of a system (a purpose is a goal, or desired outcome).
* 
* Adaptive mechanisms (genetic change, human learning, etc.)
* Adaptable subsystems ()

If any of these change, then it cannot really be called the same system.

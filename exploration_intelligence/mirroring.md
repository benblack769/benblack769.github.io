title: "Costs and benefits of mirroring"
under_construction: true
excerpt: "Mirroring is the copying of others' internal state, including their pain, in order to learn from others more effectively. I discuss its role in formal learning as well as the risks and benefits that I have personally observed in human mirroring."

# What is mirroring?

### Reinforcement learning: normal learning
*Everything backtracks to our own feelings, only source of objective learning and sanity*

### Practical limits of reinforcement learning on learning from others

*Implies significant abstraction barriers to learning from others, produces significant practical limits on this model of learning*

*We need a native addition to reinforcement learning, not an abstraction*

### Mirror model of learning

*Mirroring refers to the idea that sometimes we learn from others by watching how they react to events, and feel and act how they do in order to learn from that*


*empathy is a type of mirroring*

*Mirroring does not refer to mirror neurons.*

### Tuning of mirroring

*Mirroring all the time is clearly bad, introduces extra pain to unknown gain*

*Mirroring has a tuning parameter which can control how much it occurs*

*Allows a nice solution to the abstraction problem of reinforcement learning*

# Real examples of mirroring

## Costs of mirroring

### Case 1: Reflective stress before quals

*Stress reached irrational levels when mirrored between people before finals*
*An example of the recurrence property of mirroring getting out of control because of incorrect tuning.*
*My guess from observation is that since no one knew much about the qual, people assumed other people knew more of the dangers of qual than themselves, which is a good heuristic in most cases, but in this case was always false.*

### Case 2: Losing separation of myself and others

*This is the reason why I wrote this*



*a a*

### Case 3: Sociopathy in a mirror dependent society

*In a world where people assume everyone has a mirror, there is a way to exploit this assumption when one has the ability to turn off their mirror*

## Benefits of mirroring

*I took the same 3 problems, and gave their opposite side.*

*These are useful examples of mirroring, but also to support my belief that society has found good and bad places for every major human characteristic.*

### Case 1: Reflexive morality

### Case 2: Hyper-learning: climbing up the backs of titans via extreme mirroring

### Case 3: Dispassionate philanthropy

## Limits of mirroring

*Smart man vs Wise man*
*Perhaps this adage can be thought to mean that the smart man cannot learn from others*

### Limited observational capabilities
*We need to actually understand what they are feeling to mirror them. This is difficult even for humans*

### Cannot target learning
*The reinforcement learning idea of exploring most promising unknown paths does not work. We learn what we see, and no more*

*Creates basic limits on the depth of learning that can happen*

# Conclusion: Generalized role of mirroring

*Mirroring helps us with the highest level of learning. Allows us to learn things that cannot be learned in a single lifetime by most people*

*Helps propagate cultural and social norms*

*Is an essential thing for us to have, but has significant danger, and should be watched carefully, and recognized as something we can and should control*
